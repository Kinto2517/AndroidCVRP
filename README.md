Android Version of Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem. 

## Description
This project is an different approach of CVRP because it has different capacitated vehicle and it can either solved with 3 vehicle or unlimited vehicle. When you use unlimited vehicle you should consider that every vehicle's cost so you should optimize whether you should choose different vehicles or use same vehicle back and forth. It uses Genetic Algorithm to decide which one to use.
